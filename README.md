# Machine-Learning-Intrusion-Detection


In this challenge, we will analyze some visualizations to understand the data better and then build an IDS. A good IDS will be able to identify if new traffic that is coming into a network is normal or not.
NSL-KDD DataSet was created as part of a competition to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections.
